This repository contains implementation of substitution cipher solver based on reasearch paper by Edwin Olson.

## Research Paper:
Robust Dictionary Attack of Short Simple Substitution Ciphers - https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01611190701272369

## Removing Ungrammtical Solutions:
I have used python wrapper of language tool to remove ungrammtical sentences generated using algorithm mentioned in above paper.

## Ranking multiple solutions:
I have used stanford parser to rank multiple grammatically correct sentences.
